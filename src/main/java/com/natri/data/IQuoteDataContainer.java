/**
 * This interface defines a container that can be used
 * as a data transfer object for a specific timestamped quote
 * of a currency pair.
 *
 * Each exchange should implement their own quote class to
 * expose the data correctly.
 *
 * A currency pair consists of two currencies, one is first and one is last.
 * E.g. EUR_USD
 * The price will be how much it costs to go from USD --> EURO
 * where the first currency in the pair is the final destination.
 *
 * It is important to be able to know what is the start currency and what is the end currency,
 * regardless of the pair codes, howver they may be defined.
